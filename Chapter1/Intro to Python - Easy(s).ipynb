Often these will be \"syntax errors\" that signal that something is wrong with the form of your code (e.g., the code in the previous exercise raised a `SyntaxError`). There are also \"runtime errors\", which signal that your code was in itself formally correct, but that something went wrong during the code's execution. A good example is the `ZeroDivisionError`, which indicates that you tried to divide a number by zero (which, as you may know, is not allowed). Try to make Python **raise such a `ZeroDivisionError`.**"
